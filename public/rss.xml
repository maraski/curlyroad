A lot of girls I’ve known since I was younger have had their hair straightened at least once, and some even regularly at once or twice a year. Even I have had my hair straightened twice before that left my hair deeply damaged for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those girls is Vanessa. Last time I saw her about a year ago, she just had her hair rebonded for what she said felt like the hundredth time. Last January, she read a feature on how another curly girl revived her curls and from then on, she was hooked. She has been doing the Curly Girl Method, a method developed by Lorraine Massey specifically to care for curly hair, for a little over three months now. From the pictures she occasionally posts on Facebook, it seems like CGM is doing her good. I myself have been doing it for the past couple of weeks and while there haven’t been any dramatic change, I can see that my hair is looking better than it was before I started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She’s  curly too and it really broke my heart knowing I was showing her by my example that I did not think our curls were beautiful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weesa, a moderator from the Curly Girl PH Facebook group, had a different reason. It was her daughter that made her decide to not schedule another hair straightening appointment. When asked why, she said “she’s curly too and it really broke my heart knowing I was showing her by my example that I did not think our curls were beautiful.” Then a friend introduced her to CGM, and once she had a solid grasp of the concept, she started praciting it around October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not an overnight success, and of course, trying something new will always involve trial and error. Vanessa found it difficult to justify the amount of product and plastic waste she has to go through while doing this method. To make up for this, she says that she mostly tries “to reuse or upcycle everything and ecobrick the ones that can’t be used.” For Weesa, it took about 3 to 4 months of consistently doing CGM for her to notice stark changes. The challenges she faced were not just about products, but according to her, it was also “having to unlearn years of faulty hair care advice and society’s media driven beauty ideals, but everyday, practice becomes habit, until you eventually live your advocacy.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Weesa at 5 months practicing CGM. Used with permission.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the rewards sure outweigh any challenges. Although the recovery doesn’t happen overnight, any progress is still progress. Although she can’t help but compare her progress to others, Weesa says that having a strong support system of people going through the same transition makes a difference. For her, the progress goes deeper than just hair. She says that “you’ll see your whole outlook on self acceptance and confidence change too. You become more forgiving of your faults and kinder to yourself, and you find yourself being more generous and accepting of others too.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked what tips or advice they would give to a CGM newbie, Vanessa says to “be patient and listen to your hair”. Curly Girl Method is not a one-size-fits-all. The goal is to recover from all the damage and have healthy hair, then the natural curls will follow. Weesa advices the same, to “focus on getting your hair healthy, the curls and aesthetics will follow with patience, time and consistency.” She also recommends to take lots of progress photos, as it helps to keep your spirits up during bad days. Learn about the method as much as possible to know what to expect, and allow yourself to invest in self-care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, although it helps to have a support group, she says not to expect your progress to be like everyone elses because &lt;strong&gt;“all our curls are unique, just like our journeys.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to get started with the Curly Girl Method]]></title><description><![CDATA[Getting started with this method shouldn’t be too difficult.

So what’s next after reading all about CGM?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Prepare everything you need for the final wash&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For CGM to be successful, you’re going to have to do a final wash. The final wash is essential to clarify your hair and remove product build up from CG unapproved products, especially silicones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check for ingredients to avoid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are certain ingredients in shampoos and conditioners that are doing more harm than good to our hair.
These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sulfates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silicones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parabens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking for products without these ingredients can be tricky, but just type in the ingredients on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.curlsbot.com/&quot;&gt;online tool&lt;/a&gt; and it will tell you if the product is CG approved or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your existing hair products have these ingredients, it’s better to stop using them now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepare your product line-up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A shampoo with sulfate &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; or dishwashing liquid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conditioner of your choice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gel or styling product of your choice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microfiber towel or a cotton t-shirt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conditioner and gel or styling product &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be CG approved. The shampoo with sulfate or dishwashing liquid is the key product to remove any build up on your hair and this will only be used once. Your usual bathing towel is no good for your hair now as well, as its texture will create too much friction against your hair and will disrupt the curl clumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Do the final wash&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you’re all set, it’s time to do the final wash. This will only be done &lt;strong&gt;once&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During shower, &lt;strong&gt;use the shampoo or dishwashing liquid to wash your hair&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the most important step of the final wash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the shampoo, &lt;strong&gt;coat your hair with generous amount of conditioner&lt;/strong&gt;, making sure that every strand is coated. This is better done with your hair upside down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use your hands to squish the conditioner into your hair upwards to the roots&lt;/strong&gt;. This action will ensure that your hair will be thoroughly moisturized and your natural curl pattern will start to come out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rinse off about 3/4 of the conditioner from your hair&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s better to leave some of the conditioner on your hair, this will reduce the amount gels or styling products needed after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dry your hair with the microfiber towel or cotton t-shirt&lt;/strong&gt; using the same squishing upward motion you did with the conditioner. The goal is to reduce friction as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apply gel or any styling product&lt;/strong&gt; with the same squishing motion or with your palms touching together like you’re praying, and go along the length of your hair, by sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air dry your hair for best results&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
